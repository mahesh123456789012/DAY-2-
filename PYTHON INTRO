* Python - Python is a high level, interpreted and dynamically typed programming language.

* High level programming language - Programming languages that can be easily understood by coders because of usage of language in building logics.

* Interpreted - In interpreted programming languages, the code is translated into machine language and executed line by line at its runtime.

* Dynamically typed programming language - In dynamically typed programming languages, we do not need to specify the data type beforehand, it assigns the data type based on the value at runtime.

* Variable: Variables serve as data storage containers, which can hold various data types. They are identified by unique labels, allowing for easy data access and 
  manipulation by referring to these labels.
  Example:-
  x=15
  x is a variable which store the address of the data ype tvalue 10(where 10 is the interger data type)

* Data Types:Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data.
          Numeric
          Sequence Type
          Boolean
          Set
          Dictionary
          Binary Types
 * Type Conversion:The act of changing an objectâ€™s data type is known as type conversion. The Python interpreter automatically performs Implicit Type Conversion. Python prevents Implicit Type Conversion from losing data.
    The user converts the data types of objects using specified functions in explicit type conversion
  In Python
1.To Integer: int(x) converts x to an integer

2.To Float: float(x) converts x to a floating-point number.

3.To String: str(x) converts x to a string.
leet code problem solution:
          class Solution(object):
    def findDuplicate(self, nums):
        nums.sort()
        for i in range(1,len(nums)):
            if(nums[i]==nums[i-1]):
                return nums[i]
        return -1
